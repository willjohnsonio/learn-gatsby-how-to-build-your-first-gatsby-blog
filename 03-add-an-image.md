## Adding an image your page

The markdown syntax for images is similar to links, but with an `!` in front `![]()`

The path/url to the image goes inside of the `()`

The alt text goes inside of the `[]`

You want the images to be located inside of your blog directory because Gatbsy will automacialy optimize the image for you when you put them in your markdown.

Make sure that the file extention for images match.

```markdown
![alt text for image](./imagefile.png)
```
